# Academic-performance-analyzer

Here I have tried to determine which features affect the student's subjectwise and overall performance by looking at the data distribution overall and also based on clusters formed on the basis of scores. The features involved are:
1) gender : sex of students
2) race/ethnicity : ethnicity of students
3) parental level of education : parents' final education
4) lunch : standard or free/reduced
5) test preparation course : Any course done/completed to prepare for test or not
